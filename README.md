# Description
We want to build a game of High Low. These are the requirements:

1. Two buttons: "Higher" and "Lower".
2. On app load, it should generate a number between 1 and 100.
3. After the user selects a button, the app should generate a random number not equal to the previous number and determine if the user's choice was correct.
4. If the user wins their bet, change the background to green; if the user loses, change the background to red.
5. We should be able to keep track of total bets, win count, and win streak.
6. There should be labels to display the above stats along with the generated number.
