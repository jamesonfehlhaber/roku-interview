# Description
We want to build a game of High Low. These are the requirements:

1. Two buttons: "Higher" and "Lower"
2. On app load, it should generate a number between 1 - 100
3. After the user selects a button, the app should generate a random number not equal to the previous number and determine if the user's choice was correct
4. There should be two labels: total plays, win count
